# Benchmarking

There are many benchmarking tools such as CPU-Z, or Intel XTU that can test your system and make sure the underclock is running smoothly. In any case, all you need to do is install an appropriate benchmarking tool, and run the benchmark while monitoring your computer's temperatures. If your computer's temps get too high, you can increase the undervolt. If your computer crashes or freezes, you can decrease the undervolt. In addition to benchmarking your computer, also try using it/benchmarking it while it is unplugged. In my experience, computers are the least stable when unplugged, so by testing it then, you should see if your undervolt is stable or not.
