# How I undervolted my Dell XPS 7590

## Why undervolt?

The Dell XPS 7590 in particular has serious overheating and thermal throttling problems. Essentially, if I let the laptop run something resource intensive for too long \(usually takes about 30 min\), the laptop will get extremely hot, around 95-100 degrees celcius. This in turn, will make the laptop throttle its performance in order to get back to a stable temperature. Undervolting fixes the problem by not allowing the laptop to pass a certain amount of power supplied to the component you are undervolting. In this guide I will show how I undervolted my CPU and my GPU in order to get more performance out of my laptop.

## What you need:

* A laptop
* The laptop's charging cable
